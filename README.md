We have built an AI powered forest fire detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image
classification. The system detects the presence of fire or smoke in images, aiding in early detection and prevention of
forest fires. Implemented a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for easy testing and visualization.
